# portfolio-website
RESTFUL Express app using Node and Mongo

Personal project website incorporating back and front end. Backend done through express via node.js. Website database done through mongodb. Website follows RESTFUL routing.

Backend features:
  - User accounts and authentication
  - User forum to create posts
  - Comment sections for users to leave comments on posts. 
  
  Website will also involve all future projects that I will be working on, currently one small application I have made is on there, listed   as "memory game" on another of my repositories.
